            Hi there! I'm <strong>Bekhruzbek</strong>, the developer behind this API. I’ve created this project to provide an efficient, reliable, and easy-to-use tool that simplifies integration for developers. My goal was to build something that works seamlessly, with clean code and solid structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the development, I focused on ensuring the API is simple to use, well-documented, and scalable for future needs. I believe in building solutions that grow with the project and remain easy to maintain over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and contributions from other developers. If you have ideas for improvement or if you're interested in working together on something new, don’t hesitate to reach out!
        </p>
